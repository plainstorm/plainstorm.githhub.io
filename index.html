        <h3>
            Depression involves experiencing negative emotions such as sadness, grief, low self-esteem and hopelessness.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            Depressed states can occur spontaneously due to chemical imbalances, in connection with other mental health
            conditions, such as anxiety, or following a negative incident.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            Various events can cause depression. The
            death of a family member, breaking up with a romantic partner, getting fired from a job, ending a friendship
            or having financial struggles can all result in overwhelming sadness and persistent, negative thoughts. For
            some people, depression is genetic or hereditary and not due to an adverse event.

                <h3 class="description description8">
                    A key goal in fighting depression as a society is breaking down
                    the walls of stigma and embarrassment, and making it easier for
                    people to talk about their problems.

                <h3 class="description description9">
                    As with many illnesses, we can each make a difference by
                    helping those around us who we think may be struggling.
